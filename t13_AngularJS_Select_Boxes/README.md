AngularJS Select Boxes

Because the `ng-repeat` directive repeats a block of HTML code for each item in an array, it can be used to create options in a dropdown list, but the `ng-options` directive was made especially for filling a dropdown list with options, and has at least one important advantage:

** Dropdowns made with `ng-options` allows the selected value to be an object, while dropdowns made from `ng-repeat` has to be a string. **

## Let have a bit review

Much be very difficult to get text of an option in selectbox, but with ng-options, we can hold an selected object (include all option value and option text)
