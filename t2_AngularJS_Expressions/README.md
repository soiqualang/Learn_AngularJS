## AngularJS Expressions vs. JavaScript Expressions
* Like JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can contain literals, operators, and variables.

* Unlike JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can be written inside HTML.

* AngularJS expressions `do not support conditionals, loops, and exceptions`, while JavaScript expressions do.

* `AngularJS expressions support filters`, while JavaScript expressions do not.
